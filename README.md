# ESP32-CAM TV-backlight
Controls LEDs at the back of a TV in an Ambilight inspired way. 
All you need is an ESP32-CAM with a proper camera. I used a OV5640 with a 200Â° wide angle.
This is then hooked up to the LED strip with proper WS2812b LEDs.

Just configure it to your needs in the config.h and do the rest in the integrated web interface. So just call the IP in the browser after flashing.
